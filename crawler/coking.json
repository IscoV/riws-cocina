The homemade version was of course far better than the store bought version. Since then I’ve tried several recipes and learned a few tips and tricks along the way. The two tips I like best are replacing the traditional all-purpose flour used in the cream puffs with bread flour and replacing one of the whole eggs with two egg whites.

They were a chocolate cake doughnut covered with glaze, then icing and crushed Oreos and then they had an Oreo cream filling in the middle. Yes it was a tasty doughnut but I thought there were several things I wanted to change about them. That’s what I love about baking at home, you can make them just how you like. That is why I came home and made them my way. I thought their version was too sweet, yes this version I made is sweet but theirs was even too sweet for me. I thought the version they had made didn’t need a glaze AND an icing so I left off the glaze layer. I also didn’t like their cream filling, it tasted like canned frosting and it was to heavy for a cake doughnut so and I ended up just pushing it off and just eating the rest.

That is all I have to say. Okay not really all I have to say because these are my dream dessert, I have such a soft spot for Italian and French pastries so, really I have plenty to say about these. First of all, the cups for these are made from a cannoli dough (I made it a bit thicker than I would for a cannoli shell that would be wrapped around a flute and fried, simply so it could hold it’s shape a little better). The cups are baked in mini muffin cups, not fried. So, to add a bit of that fried flavor I sprayed them with vegetable oil before baking (so I suppose if you want to be a bit healthier you could leave it off, but I think it’s nearly a must). I’m not a traditional cannoli filling kind of person, I need a cannoli filling with Mascarpone to be completely satisfied with this dessert. There is just so much Mascarpone has to offer that Ricotta doesn’t, so whenever I make cannoli anything I always use a combo of both. Mascarpone is probably the best cheese this world has to offer. Okay along with cheddar, I am American. It’s like cream cheese meets royalty. It’s utterly creamy texture and delicate sweetness is something no other can imitate. I’d call it the cheese of Heaven. Anyways, yes cannoli needs Mascarpone but it is not the most traditional way. Another cannoli must I’d say is some form of chocolate. Whether you dip the shells in chocolate or sprinkle these with mini chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate or even chocolate curls), please don’t leave the chocolate out.

I love cooking, I hate doing dishes. Ask my husband. I’m sure I complain about it far too much). I couldn’t decide which kind of cracker to buy at the grocery store for dipping. I debated about buying the waffle cookie crackers (as it seems similar to a cannoli shell) or almond thins crackers or even anna’s thins then just decided to mix American and Italian and went with something everyone could easily find, just plain and chocolate grahams. I also tried strawberries which were amazing with this dip, reminiscent of strawberry cheesecake. Really you could use any lightly sweet kind of cracker you’d like. Biscotti would be good or if you are feeling up to it you can fry some cannoli chips or flour tortillas and dust them lightly with cinnamon after frying.
